# MPV + UOSC Customized Setup

This repository contains my personal heavily-customized setup for the [MPV media player](https://mpv.io/). It focuses on providing a modern, sleek interface with quality-of-life behavioral features tailored for an amazing viewing experience.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🎨 Modernized UOSC Interface
This setup runs on a highly modified fork of [uosc](https://github.com/tomasklaen/uosc):
*   **Stunning Timeline:** A customized thin, rounded, and elegant timeline with a subtle hover-expansion animation, matching modern design aesthetics. It features a rich dark gradient shadow, floating rounded buttons, and minimalistic font styles.
*   **Refined Control Layout:** Perfectly centered and symmetrical bottom controls using flawless iconography to mimic premium video platforms. All active states and button flashes are thoughtfully integrated into the primary color scheme.
*   **Enhanced UX & Menus:** Click anywhere seamlessly! Left or right-clicking outside of menus and playlists immediately dismisses them, keeping your view completely clear without relying solely on quick keyboard escapes.

### 🕒 Seamless History & Resume (SimpleHistory)
*   **Auto-Resume Support:** Remembers exactly where you left off on any file, seamlessly prompting or automatically resuming position upon player load.
*   **On-Demand History Menu:** Quickly peek at your recently watched media simply by pressing `h`.

### 🧰 Powerful Quality of Life Scripts
*   **Smart Folder Autoload:** Instantly queues all video files in the same directory for seamless next/prev file navigation without scanning slow subdirectories.
*   **Audio/Subtitle Quick-Switching:** Simply scroll your mouse wheel over the Audio or Subtitle buttons to instantly cycle tracks, or click to advance.
*   **Thumbfast:** High-performance, on-the-fly thumbnail generation while hovering over the timeline.
*   **PlaylistManager 2:** Robust handling of extensive playlists.
*   **Skip Intro:** Auto-skips anime and TV show intros dynamically.
*   **SmartCopyPaste 2:** Elegant clipboard integration perfect for pasting network streams.
*   **WebM Maker:** Integrated WebM encoding right from the MPV playback window.

### 🎥 High-End Shaders
*   **NVScaler:** High-quality spatial upscaling.
*   **FilmGrain-Light:** Subtle cinematic grain application to prevent color banding in dark scenes and improve visual fidelity.
