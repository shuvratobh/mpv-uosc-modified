# MPV + UOSC Customized Setup

This repository contains my personal heavily-customized setup for the [MPV media player](https://mpv.io/). It focuses on providing a modern, sleek interface with quality-of-life behavioral features tailored for an amazing viewing experience.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🎨 Modernized UOSC Interface
This setup runs on a highly modified fork of [uosc](https://github.com/tomasklaen/uosc):
*   **Stunning Timeline:** A customized thin, rounded, and elegant timeline that matches modern design sensibilities. It replaces the default blocky design with a subtle hover-expansion animation and minimalistic timestamp fonts.
*   **UX Improvements:** Includes behavioral fixes where clicking empty spaces completely closes out menus, playlists, and subtitle tracks to keep interaction clean and intuitive.

### 🕒 Seamless History & Resume (SimpleHistory)
*   **Auto-Resume Support:** Remembers exactly where you left off on any file, seamlessly prompting or automatically resuming position upon player load.
*   **On-Demand History Menu:** Quickly peek at your recently watched media simply by pressing `h`.

### 🧰 Powerful Quality of Life Scripts
*   **Thumbfast:** High-performance, on-the-fly thumbnail generation while hovering over the timeline.
*   **PlaylistManager 2:** Robust handling of extensive playlists.
*   **Skip Intro:** Auto-skips anime and TV show intros dynamically.
*   **SmartCopyPaste 2:** Elegant clipboard integration perfect for pasting network streams.
*   **WebM Maker:** Integrated WebM encoding right from the MPV playback window.

### 🎥 High-End Shaders
*   **NVScaler:** High-quality spatial upscaling.
*   **FilmGrain-Light:** Subtle cinematic grain application to prevent color banding in dark scenes and improve visual fidelity.
